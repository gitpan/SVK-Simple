SVK::Simple - Easy SVK object loader

Please notice that the 01.basic.t test will use *YOUR* ~/.svk
path as test path. But it'll not add / remove any file from it.
It just require your repository to exist to test the loader.

Normally the test will be all skiped unless it's invoked like this:

  perl -Ilib t/01.basic.t RUN

It requires $ARGV[0] to indicate that you really want to run the tests.
If it's not given that all tests are skiped.
Play this at your own risk.

Cheers,
